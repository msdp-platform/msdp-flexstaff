# FlexStaff Deployment Status

## ✅ Current Status

### Running Services
- ✅ **PostgreSQL**: Running and healthy on port **5433**
- ✅ **Redis**: Running and healthy on port **6380**

### In Progress
- ⏳ **Backend**: Docker image build in progress (npm install completed successfully - 672 packages installed)
  - The build is currently in the "exporting layers" phase which can take 5-10 minutes
- ⏳ **Frontend**: Waiting for backend to complete
- ⏳ **Admin Dashboard**: Waiting for backend to complete

## 📊 Port Assignments

| Service | Port | Status | URL |
|---------|------|--------|-----|
| PostgreSQL | 5433 | ✅ Running | localhost:5433 |
| Redis | 6380 | ✅ Running | localhost:6380 |
| Backend API | 4000 | ⏳ Building | http://localhost:4000 |
| Frontend Web | 5173 | ⏳ Pending | http://localhost:5173 |
| Admin Dashboard | 5174 | ⏳ Pending | http://localhost:5174 |

## 🚀 What's Happening Now

The automated startup script (`./start-docker.sh`) is running in the background and performing these steps:

1. ✅ **Started PostgreSQL** - Healthy and ready
2. ✅ **Started Redis** - Healthy and ready
3. ⏳ **Building Backend** - npm install complete (17 minutes), now exporting Docker image layers
4. ⏳ **Next: Start Backend container**
5. ⏳ **Next: Build and start Frontend**
6. ⏳ **Next: Build and start Admin**

## ⏱️ Estimated Time Remaining

- Backend image export: ~5-10 minutes
- Backend container start: ~1 minute
- Frontend build: ~15-20 minutes (npm install)
- Admin build: ~15-20 minutes (npm install)

**Total estimated time: 35-50 minutes from now**

## 🔍 Monitor Progress

You can monitor the progress with these commands:

```bash
# Check running containers
docker ps | grep flexstaff

# View all build/startup logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Check the startup script progress (running in background)
# The script will output completion message when done

# Check backend build logs specifically
docker-compose logs backend
```

## 📝 What to Do

### Option 1: Wait for Automated Completion (Recommended)
The background script will complete all steps automatically. You'll see this message when done:
```
✅ All services started!

📋 Access your applications at:
   - Backend API:      http://localhost:4000
   - Frontend Web:     http://localhost:5173
   - Admin Dashboard:  http://localhost:5174
```

### Option 2: Manual Intervention (If Needed)
If you want to stop the current process and try a different approach:

```bash
# Stop all FlexStaff services
docker-compose down

# Build services one at a time manually
docker-compose build backend    # Takes ~20 min first time
docker-compose build frontend   # Takes ~20 min first time
docker-compose build admin      # Takes ~20 min first time

# Then start all services
docker-compose up -d
```

## 🎯 Once Everything is Running

### Access Your Applications

1. **Backend API** - http://localhost:4000
   - Test: `curl http://localhost:4000/health`

2. **Frontend Web App** - http://localhost:5173
   - For workers and employers to browse and apply for shifts

3. **Admin Dashboard** - http://localhost:5174
   - Login with admin credentials
   - Manage users, shifts, payments, disputes

### Database Access

- **PostgreSQL**: `postgresql://flexstaff_user:flexstaff_pass@localhost:5433/flexstaff_db`
- **Redis**: `localhost:6380`

## 🛠️ Common Commands

```bash
# View logs
docker-compose logs -f [service-name]

# Restart a service
docker-compose restart [service-name]

# Stop all services
docker-compose down

# Stop and remove all data (fresh start)
docker-compose down -v

# Rebuild a service
docker-compose up --build -d [service-name]
```

## 📂 Files Ready

All configuration files are in place:
- ✅ `docker-compose.yml` - Complete orchestration
- ✅ `backend/Dockerfile.dev` - Backend container
- ✅ `frontend/Dockerfile.dev` - Frontend container
- ✅ `admin/Dockerfile.dev` - Admin container
- ✅ `.env` - Environment variables
- ✅ `start-docker.sh` - Automated startup script
- ✅ `DOCKER_SETUP.md` - Complete documentation

## 🎉 What You've Accomplished

1. ✅ Complete FlexStaff application (Backend + Frontend + Admin + Mobile apps)
2. ✅ Docker configuration with port conflict resolution
3. ✅ Database and cache services running
4. ✅ Admin backoffice with 7 complete pages (Dashboard, Users, Shifts, Payments, Disputes, Reports, Settings)
5. ⏳ Automated deployment in progress

**The system is building and will be ready soon!** The first build always takes longest due to npm package installation. Subsequent builds will be much faster thanks to Docker layer caching.
